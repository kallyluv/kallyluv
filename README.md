<h3 align="center">About Me</h2><hr>
Hey there! My name is Jay and I am a small-time software engineer. I specialize in JavaScript & PHP and have 5 years of experience building, maintaining, and refining my skills through numerous projects and businesses. I am not limited to just JavaScript & PHP, however, and I have learned and am mastering many other languages such as Python, AHK, Golang, and more recently C++. I enjoy every nature of software engineering and programming is a massive part of my life. I have many smaller side projects where I design UIs, GUIs, and/or textures for games. Most of my work is either through commissions or privatized programs I have written working for small companies/organizations, so what you see here does not 100% represent my capabilities. Currently, my main focus in the realm of programming is a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server by the name of <a href="https://discord.com/invite/SAPZBPS">AvengeTech</a>! I specialize in turning ideas or designs into useable programs & features and I do my utmost to uphold an image of a person that can do anything and make anything happen.

<h3 align="center">Minecraft</h3><hr>

I absolutely adore everything about Minecraft, both Java and Bedrock Editions. I used to do an extreme amount of development in this realm and am highly experienced with creating plugins for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP) (PMMP), a Minecraft: Bedrock Edition server software. I have been a part of the PMMP community for 4 years and am well versed on the ins and outs of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition's technical side. In the PMMP community I specialize in being a person that makes possible what others deemed impossible. I also occasionally design texture packs for both __Minecraft: Java Edition__ and __Minecraft: Bedrock Edition__; my most recent being [Modernized 128x](https://github.com/xJustJqy/Modernized-128x).

<h3 align="center">JavaScript/Node.js</h3><hr>

When it comes to JavaScript and it's libraries, I am nothing short of an expert. Since early 2019, I've been writing in and using JavaScript and it's various libraries to create incredible programs, websites, and other various applications. I use the asynchronous lib [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) the most out of everything. The amount of ground that Node.js and it's module library covers in the programming world is incredible and allows for great ease-of-access when writing complex programs. I first used Node.js in late 2019 when I found myself interested in [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), Discord's very own Node.js API. I've created many various Discord bots, for fun and for a multitude of organizations/guilds. I've also dabbled in <a href="https://electronjs.org">Electron.js</a>, creating small desktop applications and programs for Windows 10. My project <a href="https://github.com/xJustJqy/Live-Wallpapers">Live-Wallpapers</a> is probably my most notable public program and was my attempt at a standalone application equivalent to that of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/431960/Wallpaper_Engine/">Wallpaper Engine</a> on Steam.

<h3 align="center">Database/Webserver Engineering</h3><hr>

As I previously mentioned, I am highly experienced in JavaScript and PHP. This skill allows me to create highly efficient, lightweight databases/webservers that not only take up minimal storage space, but an incredibly low amount of processing. Most of these are written using the asynchronous library [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/) that allows me to have a server process data on multiple threads, creating the opportunity to achieve peak performance. I have done this for many smaller organizations looking for simple backend servers that are efficient, easy to use, and last the test of time.
