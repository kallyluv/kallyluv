<h3 align="center">About Me</h2><hr>
Hey there! My name is Jay and I am a small-time software engineer. I specialize in JavaScript and have 5 years of experience building, maintaining, and refining my skills through numerous projects and businesses. I am the founder of <a href="https://github.com/JSRoyals">JSRoyals</a>, a group dedicated to creating helpful JavaScript-based programs and/or libraries. I am not limited to just JavaScript, however, and I have learned and mastered many other languages such as PHP, Python, AHK, and more recently Golang. I enjoy every nature of software engineering and programming is a massive part of my life. I have many smaller side projects where I design UIs, GUIs, and/or textures for games. Most of my work are either commissions or things I have done working for small companies, so what you see here does not 100% represent my capabilities.

<h3 align="center">Minecraft</h3><hr>

I absolutely adore everything about Minecraft, both Java and Bedrock Editions. I do an extreme amount of development in this realm and am highly experienced with creating plugins for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP). I have been attempting to learn how to write in Java in the hopes that I will be able to create __Minecraft: Java Edition__ mods (Forge & Fabric). I also specialize in designing texture packs for both __Minecraft: Java Edition__ and __Minecraft: Bedrock Edition__; my most recent being [Modernized 128x](https://github.com/xJustJqy/Modernized-128x).

<h3 align="center">Database/Webserver Engineering</h3><hr>

As I previously mentioned in [About Me](#about-me), I am highly experienced in JavaScript. This skill allows me to create highly efficient, lightweight databases/webservers that not only take up minimal storage space, but an incredibly low amount of processing. Most of these are written using an asynchronous language called [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). This allows me to have a server process data on multiple threads, creating the opportunity to achieve peak performance.

<h3 align="center">Support Me </h3><hr>

As of late, I have been running low on time and money to dedicate to projects. Supporting me by [Sponsoring me on Github](https://github.com/sponsors/xJustJqy) or on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/sir_e_of_cali) would help me to allocate more funding & time to working on projects. Any and all support is greatly appreciated and will be used wisely! If you cannot donate, do not fret! You still have the ability to support me by showing my work to your friends, family, and others!
