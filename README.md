<h3 align="center">About Me</h2><hr>
Hey there! My name is Jay and I am a small-time software engineer. I specialize in JavaScript & PHP and have 5 years of experience building, maintaining, and refining my skills through numerous projects and businesses. I am not limited to just JavaScript & PHP, however, and I have learned and mastered many other languages such as Python, AHK, Golang, and more recently C++. I enjoy every nature of software engineering and programming is a massive part of my life. I have many smaller side projects where I design UIs, GUIs, and/or textures for games. Most of my work is either through commissions or privatized programs I have written working for small companies, so what you see here does not 100% represent my capabilities. Currently, my main focus in the realm of programming is my very own independent game company <a href="https://github.com/JECKAL-Entertainment" style="text-decoration:none">JECKAL</a>!

<h3 align="center">Minecraft</h3><hr>

I absolutely adore everything about Minecraft, both Java and Bedrock Editions. I used to do an extreme amount of development in this realm and am highly experienced with creating plugins for [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP). I've also expanded into GoLang, developing a server in GoLang's very own [Dragonfly](https://github.com/df-mc/dragonfly). I also occasionally design texture packs for both __Minecraft: Java Edition__ and __Minecraft: Bedrock Edition__; my most recent being [Modernized 128x](https://github.com/xJustJqy/Modernized-128x).

<h3 align="center">Database/Webserver Engineering</h3><hr>

As I previously mentioned in [About Me](#about-me), I am highly experienced in JavaScript. This skill allows me to create highly efficient, lightweight databases/webservers that not only take up minimal storage space, but an incredibly low amount of processing. Most of these are written using an asynchronous language called [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/). This allows me to have a server process data on multiple threads, creating the opportunity to achieve peak performance.
